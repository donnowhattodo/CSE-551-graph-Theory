Community Detection in Graphs vs. Hypergraphs for Gene Function Prediction: A comparative study using hyperNETX to explore the effectiveness of hypergraphs in capturing complex gene interactions and enhancing functional predictions.

# Community Detection in Graphs vs. Hypergraphs for Gene Function Prediction

This project explores the application of community detection in both graphs and hypergraphs to predict gene functions. By utilizing the `hypernetx` library, we compare traditional graph-based community detection methods with hypergraph-based approaches to understand the benefits of modeling multi-gene interactions in biological networks.

## Background
Community detection is crucial in understanding the organization of complex networks, particularly in biological systems where genes often function in groups. While traditional graph models connect genes in pairwise interactions, hypergraphs allow us to capture higher-order relationships involving multiple genes simultaneously. This project aims to leverage hypergraphs for more accurate community detection, enhancing gene function prediction.

## Objective
- **Compare**: Analyze the differences in community structures detected in graphs vs. hypergraphs.
- **Predict**: Use detected communities to predict gene functions.
- **Evaluate**: Assess the biological significance of the communities in terms of functional enrichment.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Obtain gene interaction data from public databases.
2. **Model Construction**:
   - Construct a traditional graph where edges represent pairwise gene interactions.
   - Construct a hypergraph using `hypernetx`, where hyperedges can connect multiple genes.
3. **Community Detection**:
   - Apply traditional community detection algorithms (e.g., Louvain) on the graph.
   - Use `hypernetx` to detect communities in the hypergraph.
4. **Analysis**:
   - Compare the detected communities in terms of modularity and biological relevance.
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of each approach in predicting gene functions.
5. **Results and Paper Writing**: Document findings and structure them into a conference paper format.
