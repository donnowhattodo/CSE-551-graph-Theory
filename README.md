Community Detection in Graphs vs. Hypergraphs for Gene Function Prediction: A comparative study using hyperNETX to explore the effectiveness of hypergraphs in capturing complex gene interactions and enhancing functional predictions. (Community Detection in the YouTube Social Network)

## Overview

The study of community detection in large-scale networks is crucial for understanding the structural and functional relationships between entities across social, biological, and technological systems. This project focuses on community detection within the YouTube social network, aiming to uncover groups of users who share similar interests, interactions, or behaviors. These communities provide valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of the network, such as content spread, influencer emergence, and user engagement formation.

## Project Goals

- Leverage both traditional graph structures and advanced hypergraph models for community detection.
- Compare the effectiveness of graph-based and hypergraph-based approaches.
- Enhance accuracy in identifying communities, leading to better content recommendation systems, user segmentation, and influencer identification.

## Methodology

### Data Representation

1. **Graphs**: In traditional graphs, interactions are modeled as pairwise relationships between users, where each edge represents a direct connection between two nodes. This representation captures many types of social interactions but can be limited in complexity.

2. **Hypergraphs**: Hypergraphs allow for higher-order relationships by enabling connections between multiple nodes through hyperedges, offering a more flexible and accurate representation of interactions.

### Tools and Libraries

- **NetworkX**: Used for efficient manipulation and analysis of graph structures.
- **HyperNETX**: Used for handling and analyzing hypergraphs.

### Community Detection Techniques

- **Louvain Modularity**: A method to detect communities by optimizing modularity.
- **Spectral Clustering**: A clustering technique based on the eigenvalues of the graph's Laplacian.

### Data Processing

1. Convert the raw YouTube network data into both graph and hypergraph formats.
2. Apply clustering algorithms and community detection techniques to identify communities within the network.

## Research Questions

- Do hypergraphs provide a more accurate representation of social dynamics and community structures within the YouTube network compared to traditional graph models?

## Expected Outcomes

The findings from this project aim to improve the understanding of social interactions and the roles users play in online platforms. This can contribute to more efficient and personalized systems for user engagement and community-driven services.

## Conclusion

Through careful evaluation of both graph-based and hypergraph-based community detection methods, this research seeks to enhance the accuracy of identifying communities within the YouTube social network, providing insights that can be leveraged in various domains.
